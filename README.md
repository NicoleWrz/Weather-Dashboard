## Description
This project uses [OpenWeather One Call Api](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retreieve weather data for any city that a user wants.
When a user searches for a city, they are presented with the current weather that includes the date, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. The
UV index color changes based on the conditions, green = favorable, yellow = moderate, red = severe. The future forcasts for the next 5 days also populates
including date, temperature, humidity, wind sleep and an icon representation of weather conditions. Local storage is also used to save previous searched 
cities for users to click on whenever they need that information again.
